issues 1:
1. Running node.js forever. I am using putty to run the script (using nodemon) but the problem is, when I close the putty terminal, the script stops
working. The reason is, because I am running the script from the putty terminal, its actually a child process of the terminal process. What needs to be done
is that, running the app.js script as a background daemon, so that, even when the putty terminal gets timed out or closed forcibly, the daemon will still run.

To do that:

npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start app.js
